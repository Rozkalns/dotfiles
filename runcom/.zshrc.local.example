# Local machine-specific configuration (example)
# Copy this to ~/.zshrc.local (not tracked in git)
# This file is sourced by .zshrc and is safe for tools like Herd to modify

# Example: Work-specific environment variables
# export WORK_PROJECT_PATH="$HOME/work/projects"

# Example: API keys and secrets (NEVER commit these!)
# export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Example: Machine-specific PATH additions
# export PATH="/opt/custom/bin:$PATH"

# Herd will inject its configuration here automatically when installed:
# - PHP configuration paths
# - NVM integration
# - Herd shell integration
# - PHP binary paths
